Thanks for using react-virtualized! :)

Before creating an issue...

# Are you asking a question?
Please don't file GitHub issues to ask questions. Use Stack Overflow with a #react-virtualized tag [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-virtualized] or ask in the react-virtualized Slack channel [https://react-virtualized.now.sh].

# Are you reporting a bug or runtime error?
Please include either a failing unit test or a Plnkr demonstrating the bug you are reporting. You can start by forking this Plnk! https://plnkr.co/edit/6syKo8cx3RfoO96hXFT1

You may also find the online Babel tool (https://babeljs.io/repl/) quite helpful if you wish to use ES6/ES7 syntax not yet supported by the browser you are using.

# Are you making a feature request?
Provide as much information as possible about your requested feature. Here are a few questions you may consider answering:
* What's your use case? (Tell me about your application and what problem you're trying to solve.)
* What interface do you have in mind? (What new properties or methods do you think might be helpful?)
* Can you point to similar functionality with any existing libraries or components? (Working demos can be helpful.)
