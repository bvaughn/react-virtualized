## Asking a Question?

Please don't file GitHub issues to ask questions! Instead use:
* Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-virtualized

### Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?

Requesting a feature?

Provide as much information as possible about your requested feature. Here are a few questions you may consider answering:

* What's your use case? (Tell me about your application and what problem you're trying to solve.)
* What interface do you have in mind? (What new properties or methods do you think might be helpful?)
* Can you point to similar functionality with any existing libraries or components? (Working demos can be helpful.)

Reporting a Bug?

Please include either a failing unit test or a simple repro. You can start by forking this Code Sandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/03qpzq1p9p?module=%2FExample.js

### What is the current behavior?

If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React and react-virtualized. Paste the link to your [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/03qpzq1p9p?module=%2FExample.js) below:

### What is the expected behavior?

### Which versions of React and react-virtualized, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of react-virtualized?
