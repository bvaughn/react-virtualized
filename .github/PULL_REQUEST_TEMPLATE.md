Thanks for contributing to react-virtualized!

**Before submitting a pull request,** please complete the following checklist:

- [ ] The existing test suites (`npm test`) all pass
- [ ] For any new features or bug fixes, both positive and negative test cases have been added
- [ ] For any new features, documentation has been added
- [ ] For any documentation changes, the text has been proofread and is clear to both experienced users and beginners.
- [ ] Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn run prettier`).
- [ ] Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) typechecks (`yarn run typecheck`).

Here is a short checklist of additional things to keep in mind before submitting:

- Please make sure your pull request description makes it very clear what you're trying to accomplish. If it's a bug fix, please also provide a failing test case (if possible). In either case, please add additional unit test coverage for your changes. :)
- Be sure you have notifications setup so that you'll see my code review responses. (I may ask you to make some adjustments before merging.)
