FlexTable
---------------

Table component with fixed headers and virtualized rows for improved performance with large data sets.
This component expects explicit width, height, and padding parameters.

### Prop Types
| Property | Type | Required? | Description |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| children | [FlexColumn](FlexColumn.md) | ✓ | One or more FlexColumns describing the data displayed in this row |
| className | String |  | CSS class name |
| disableHeader | Boolean |  | Disable rendering the header at all |
| headerClassName | String |  | CSS class to apply to all column headers |
| headerHeight | Number | ✓ | Fixed height of header row |
| height | Number | ✓ | Fixed/available height for out DOM element |
| horizontalPadding | Number |  | Horizontal padding of outer DOM element |
| noRowsRenderer |  | Function | Callback used to render placeholder content when :rowsCount is 0 |
| onHeaderClick |  | Function | Callback invoked when a user clicks on a table header. `(dataKey: string, columnData: any): void` |
| onRowClick |  | Function | Callback invoked when a user clicks on a table row. `(rowIndex: number): void` |
| onRowsRendered |  | Function | Callback invoked with information about the slice of rows that were just rendered: `({ startIndex, stopIndex }): void` |
| overscanRowsCount |  | Number | Number of rows to render above/below the visible bounds of the list. These rows can help for smoother scrolling on touch devices. |
| rowClassName | String or Function |  | CSS class to apply to all table rows (including the header row). This value may be either a static string or a function with the signature `(rowIndex: number): string`. Note that for the header row an index of `-1` is provided. |
| rowGetter | Function | ✓ | Callback responsible for returning a data row given an index. `(index: int): any` |
| rowHeight | Number or Function | ✓ | Either a fixed row height (number) or a function that returns the height of a row given its index: `(index: number): number` |
| rowsCount | Number | ✓ | Number of rows in table. |
| sort | Function |  | Sort function to be called if a sortable header is clicked. `(dataKey: string, sortDirection: SortDirection): void` |
| sortBy | String |  | Data is currently sorted by this `dataKey` (if it is sorted at all) |
| sortDirection | [SortDirection](SortDirection.md) |  | Data is currently sorted in this direction (if it is sorted at all) |
| verticalPadding | Number |  | Vertical padding of outer DOM element |

### Public Methods

##### recomputeRowHeights
Recompute row heights and offsets.

VirtualScroll has no way of knowing when its underlying list data has changed since it only receives a `rowHeight` property. If the `rowHeight` is a number it can compare before and after values but if it is a function that comparison is error prone. In the event that a dynamic `rowHeight` function is in use and the row heights have changed this function should be manually called by the "smart" container parent.

##### scrollToRow

Scroll the list to ensure the row at the specified index is visible. This method exists so that a user can forcefully scroll to the same row twice. (The `scrollToIndex` property would not change in that case and so it would not be picked up by VirtualScroll.)

### Class names
