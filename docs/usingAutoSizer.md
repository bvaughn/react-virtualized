Using AutoSizer
---------------

The `AutoSizer` component decorates a React element and automatically manages `width` and `height` properties so that decorated element fills the available space. This simplifies usage of components like `Grid`, `Table`, and `List` that require explicit dimensions.

This guide covers a few of the most commonly asked questions about using the component.

### Observation

This component uses [`javascript-detect-element-resize`](https://github.com/sdecima/javascript-detect-element-resize) algorithm, and it does a little direct DOM manipulation to its parent, outside React's VirtualDOM.

If the parent has style `position: static` (default value), it changes to `position: relative`. It also injects a sibling `div` for size measuring.

#### Why is my `AutoSizer` setting a height of 0?
`AutoSizer` expands to _fill_ its parent but it will not _stretch_ the parent.
This is done to prevent problems with flexbox layouts.
If `AutoSizer` is reporting a height (or width) of 0- then it's likely that the parent element (or one of its parents) has a height of 0.
One easy way to test this is to add a style property (eg `background-color: red;`) to the parent to ensure that it is the correct size.
(eg You may need to add `height: 100%` or `flex: 1` to the parent.)

#### Can I use AutoSizer to manage only width or height (not both)?
You can use `AutoSizer` to control only one dimension of its child component using the `disableHeight` or `disableWidth` attributes. For example, a fixed-height component that should grow to fill the available width can be created like so:

```jsx
<AutoSizer disableHeight>
  {({ width }) => (
    <Component
      height={200}
      width={width}
      {...props}
    />
  )}
</AutoSizer>
```

#### Can I use AutoSizer within a flex container?
When using an `AutoSizer` as a direct child of a flex box it usually works out best to wrap it with a div, like so:

```jsx
<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
  <!-- Other children... -->
  <div style={{ flex: '1 1 auto' }}>
    <AutoSizer>
      {({ height, width }) => (
        <Component
          width={width}
          height={height}
          {...props}
        />
      )}
    </AutoSizer>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Can I use AutoSizer with other HOCs like InfiniteLoader?
`AutoSizer` can be used within other react-virtualized HOCs such as `InfiniteLoader` or `ScrollSync` like so:

```jsx
<InfiniteLoader {...infiniteLoaderProps}>
  {({ onRowsRendered, registerChild }) => (
    <AutoSizer>
      {({ height, width }) => (
        <List
          ref={registerChild}
          width={width}
          height={height}
          onRowsRendered={onRowsRendered}
          {...listProps}
        />
      )}
    </AutoSizer>
  )}
</InfiniteLoader>
```

### Applying Content Security Policy
[The specification of Content Security Policy](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/REC-CSP2-20161215/#intro)
describes as the following:

> This document defines Content Security Policy, a mechanism web applications
> can use to mitigate a broad class of content injection vulnerabilities, such
> as cross-site scripting (XSS).

To apply Content Security Policy, pass a `nonce` to _react-virtualized_ and add a matching `nonce-source` to the `Content-Security-Policy` field in HTTP header.
