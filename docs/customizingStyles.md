## Customizing Classes and Styles

React virtual CSS styles are split into their own, separately loaded stylesheet in order to simplify universal/isomorphic usage while also enabling styles to be customized. This stylesheet should be imported somewhere (usually during bootstrapping) like so:

```js
import 'react-virtualized/styles.css';
```

You can also customize component styles in any of the ways below:

#### Forked Styles

Fork the react-virtualized `styles.css` file and load your own, totally custom styles.

#### Global CSS

Load an additional, external CSS file that defines global classes (eg. `.ReactVirtualized__Table`, `.ReactVirtualized__Table__row`) to append to default inline styles.

Learn more about which class names a component supports in the [API docs](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/blob/master/docs/).

#### CSS Modules

If you are using CSS modules you can specify custom class names to be appended to a component instance (eg. `Table` supports `className`, `headerClassName`, `footerClassName` and `rowClassName` properties).

Learn more about which class names are supported in the [API docs](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/blob/master/docs/).

#### Inline Styles

react-virtualized components support inline style props for style overrides.
