AutoSizer
---------------

High-order component that automatically adjusts the width and height of a single child.

### Prop Types
| Property | Type | Required? | Description |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| children | Function | âœ“ | Function responsible for rendering children. This function should implement the following signature: `({ height: number, width: number }) => PropTypes.element` |
| className | String |  | Optional custom CSS class name to attach to root `AutoSizer` element. This is an advanced property and is not typically necessary. |
| defaultHeight | Number |  | Height passed to child for initial render; useful for server-side rendering. This value will be overridden with an accurate height after mounting. |
| defaultWidth | Number |  | Width passed to child for initial render; useful for server-side rendering. This value will be overridden with an accurate width after mounting. |
| disableHeight | Boolean |  | Fixed `height`; if specified, the child's `height` property will not be managed |
| disableWidth | Boolean |  | Fixed `width`; if specified, the child's `width` property will not be managed |
| nonce | String | | Nonce of the inlined stylesheets for [Content Security Policy](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/REC-CSP2-20161215/#script-src-the-nonce-attribute) |
| onResize | Function |  | Callback to be invoked on-resize; it is passed the following named parameters: `({ height: number, width: number })`. | 
| style | Object |  | Optional custom inline style to attach to root `AutoSizer` element. This is an advanced property and is not typically necessary. |

### Examples

Many react-virtualized components require explicit dimensions but sometimes you just want a component to just grow to fill all of the available space.
The `AutoSizer` component can be useful in this case.

One word of caution about using `AutoSizer` with flexbox containers.
Flex containers don't prevent their children from growing and `AutoSizer` greedily grows to fill as much space as possible.
Combining the two can cause a loop.
The simple way to fix this is to nest `AutoSizer` inside of a `block` element (like a `<div>`) rather than putting it as a direct child of the flex container.

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { AutoSizer, List } from 'react-virtualized';
import 'react-virtualized/styles.css'; // only needs to be imported once

// List data as an array of strings
const list = [
  'Brian Vaughn'
  // And so on...
];

function rowRenderer ({ key, index, style}) {
  return (
    <div
      key={key}
      style={style}
    >
      {list[index]}
    </div>
  )
}

// Render your list
ReactDOM.render(
  <AutoSizer>
    {({ height, width }) => (
      <List
        height={height}
        rowCount={list.length}
        rowHeight={20}
        rowRenderer={rowRenderer}
        width={width}
      />
    )}
  </AutoSizer>,
  document.getElementById('example')
);
```
